# DSTA BrainHack Hackathon (mobile app development)

My group developed an app called StyleSwipe, a platform for users to exchange pre-owned pieces of clothes with each 
other, inspired by the mechanics implemented in the app Tinder. Our app aims to foster a culture of thrifting through user-to-user interactions to ultimately promote and adopt sustainable fashion consumption practice
